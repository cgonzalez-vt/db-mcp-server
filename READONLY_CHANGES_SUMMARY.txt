DB MCP SERVER - READ-ONLY MODE CHANGES SUMMARY
==============================================

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. Tool Registry (internal/delivery/mcp/tool_registry.go):
   - Removed "execute" and "transaction" tools from toolTypeNames
   - Removed "performance" tool from toolTypeNames  
   - Disabled TimescaleDB tools registration
   - Only "query" and "schema" tools remain

2. Tool Types (internal/delivery/mcp/tool_types.go):
   - Added validateReadOnlyQuery() function to block write operations
   - Updated QueryTool description to indicate "read-only" and "SELECT only"
   - Query tool now validates SQL before execution
   - Removed execute, transaction, and performance tools from factory registration

3. DB Tools (pkg/dbtools/dbtools.go):
   - Removed dbExecute tool registration
   - Updated dbQuery tool description to indicate "read-only"
   - Removed execute, transaction, and performance tools from MCP tool registration
   - Only query and schema tools are registered per database

4. Query Handler (pkg/dbtools/query.go):
   - Added validateReadOnlyQuery() function
   - Query handler validates SQL before execution
   - Blocks: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, REPLACE, MERGE, GRANT, REVOKE, EXEC, EXECUTE, CALL
   - Blocks patterns like: "SELECT INTO", "INTO OUTFILE", "INTO DUMPFILE"

5. Main Server (cmd/server/main.go):
   - Updated tool listing to show only query and schema tools
   - Added "(READ-ONLY MODE)" label to logging

6. Tests (pkg/dbtools/query_validation_test.go):
   - Created comprehensive test suite for read-only validation
   - Tests valid SELECT queries (pass)
   - Tests invalid write operations (blocked)

TOOLS AVAILABLE IN READ-ONLY MODE:
----------------------------------
Per Database:
  - query_<dbid>: Execute read-only SQL queries (SELECT statements only)
  - schema_<dbid>: Get database schema

Global:
  - list_databases: List all available databases

TOOLS REMOVED:
--------------
  - execute_<dbid> (write operations)
  - transaction_<dbid> (transaction management)
  - performance_<dbid> (performance analysis)
  - All TimescaleDB tools (hypertable creation, compression policies, etc.)

VALIDATION:
-----------
All SQL queries are now validated before execution to ensure they are read-only.
Any attempt to execute write operations will be rejected with a clear error message.

BUILD STATUS:
------------
✓ All tests passing
✓ Build successful
✓ Server starts correctly
✓ Tools registered properly
✓ Read-only validation working

USAGE:
------
The server operates exactly as before, but only allows SELECT queries.
Any write operations will be rejected with an error message like:
  "write operations are not allowed in read-only mode: detected INSERT statement"
